/* Transition

In this chapter you will learn about the following properties:

    transition
    transition-delay
    transition-duration
    transition-property
    transition-timing-function

The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

    ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
    linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
    ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
    ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
    ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
    cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
